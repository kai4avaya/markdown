My career began at the intersection of education and advocacy, where I founded and led a company dedicated to supporting neurodiverse populations. This firsthand experience revealed the profound need for better tools and inspired my shift into technology. Today, I build at the exciting convergence of art, movement, AI, and learning. My driving force is to leverage technology to craft more intuitive and equitable experiences, blurring the line between the digital and the physical to unlock new ways of teaching and understanding.
